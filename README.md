## About the Project

NFT Builder application that allows a person to enter the crypto world through Transak using Fiat.

The application deploys a SmartContract (ERC-721) on the ETH network using Web3.js, paying the gas fee with the ETH that the user acquires through Transak.

The idea is that with simple steps the user can create an NFT without even having to have an account with a cryptocurrency exchange.
